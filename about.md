Hi there! Thanks for visitng my blog!

I have been working as a [Software Engineer][] since 2010. Throughout this time I have always searched for answers online to questions about guides, toubleshooting, practical examples of using new frameworks and implementing paradigms. I always come across blog posts by individuals that show great examples, answer my questions and more! I learn a lot more than what I initially search for, helping me become a better software engineer.  

I feel that I want to give back to the community aswell by sharing my software engineering experiences. Exactly how other blogs have helped me, I hope the blog posts I write will in turn help someone somewhere.
